# aws_lambda_skel
Skel for Lambda Functions

# The Minimum
I wanted to create a small app as a starting point for creating AWS Lambda functions.  This is it.

# Usage

`$ vim Makefile # edit variables as needed`

`$ make bucket`

`$ make build`

`$ make publish`

`$ make run`

Then get rid of it all

`make clean`
